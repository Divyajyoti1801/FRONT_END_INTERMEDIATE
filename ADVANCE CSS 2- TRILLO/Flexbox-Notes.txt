FLEXBOX: 1-D Layout

Flexbox is a new module in CSS3 that makes it easy to align elements to one another in different directions and orders.
The main idea behind flexbox is to give the container the ability to expand and to shrink elements to best use all the available space.
Flexbox replaces float layouts, using less, and more readable and logical code.
